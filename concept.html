                    <p style="color:black">A neural network is defined as a computer system modeled on the human brain. Just as the human brain is able to recognize patterns, computers can do the same.
                Supervised learning is when a computer algorithm is trained to find patterns based on the data from various inputs and outputs. Using this technique, 
            the computer can eventually predict the output with an input that it has never seen before.</a>
        <br><br>
                    In this scenario, the computer is given millions of black and white images along with their corresponding colored images. For example, given millions of pictures of trees in both color and grayscale, the algorithm
                    can recognize that leaves are typically green, and thus has less trouble colorzing leaves in photos. On the other hand, say you took a look at a million different grayscale images of people wearing shirts. It would be impossible to guess
                    exactly what color they were wearing right? The computer has the same difficulty answering this question, and thus leaves room for error.
